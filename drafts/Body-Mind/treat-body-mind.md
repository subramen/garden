## Introduction

What is a human body? Is it a temple housing a supreme intelligence, or is the intelligence of its own accord? The former dualistic view, flourishing in the East since millenia before Descartes, is at the foundation of 

Our bodies are the primary way we interact with the world, and perhaps the first language we ever learn.
When interacting with the world outside us, the body is stimulated - by light on our eyes, scents in our nostrils - and generates some information which forms the fodder for intelligence. The perception of any stimulus sets off a complex biochemical framework that fundamentally dictates how we feel and act. This is where sits free-will, hidden away in complex interactions of body, mind and the world.


## Categorization

### what
A fundamental process in both human and machine intelligence is "categorization". It is the ability to differentiate and classify objects and concepts into distinct categories, and it is a skill that develops early on in life. From a young age, we learn to categorize what is safe and unsafe to eat, and what can and cannot be touched. 

### why
- Without the ability to categorize, life would be an undefined soup of everything happening all at once. There would be no organization, no way to differentiate between one thing and the next, and no way of making sense of the world. 
- These categories help us create different behaviour patterns when interacting with different things, and allow us to discriminate between different concepts, values, and language to describe the world.

<!---
Computer scientist and philosopher Rolf Pfeiffer makes a startling suggestion in his book that a fundamental form of intelligence is the ability to categorize. Categorization is what enables you to discriminate between things, concepts and value judgements

## Mind-body Interconnectedness 
The brain is the least understood organ in our bodies. Throughout history, scientists have grappled with the mystery inside our skulls by metaphorically comparing it to the technology of the day. Metaphors are a powerful tool to learn a new concept from familiar perspectives. Through comparisons with the clock, telephone exchange, CPU, internet and most recently the gradient descent algorithm, we are gradually piecing together a picture of the brain. 

Some metaphors however have held back our understanding of intelligence. Descartes' mind/body dualism ~argument~ fallacy (among others) (sidenote: read ChatGPT's more [nuanced take](https://gist.github.com/suraj813/43b887e545f9fe9159c549d0424f587f) on this debate) reduced the body to a meatbag that is inhabited and guided by the mind. While philosophers across time and geography made poetic use of metaphors to describe the unity of mind/body - "seal and wax" (Aquinas), "cubical shape (: soul) is a property of a toy building block (: body)" (Aristotle), "sheaves of reeds leaning against each other" (Buddha Shakyamuni) - more recent studies of robot dynamics drive home the message about the intelligence of the body more effectively.

Western science - studying things in isolation - separating the mind from the brain - studying the brain separately from the body - miss out on the synergy of systems

>  A human cell is a remarkable piece of networked machinery that has about the same number of components as a modern jumbo jet – all of which arose out of a longstanding, embedded encounter with the natural world. 

> The traditional view of evolution suggests that our cellular complexity evolved from early eukaryotes via random genetic mutation and selection. But in 2005 the biologist James Shapiro at the University of Chicago outlined a radical new narrative. He argued that eukaryotic cells work ‘intelligently’ to adapt a host organism to its environment by manipulating their own DNA in response to environmental stimuli.


## Where is the body's intelligence or "phenomenal consciousness"?
The brain is the least understood organ in our body, yet it is perhaps the most important in terms of our understanding of intelligence. If we want to understand the processes of our own intelligence, we must first take a step back and gain an appreciation of the fact that the brain is an organ of the body, not a separate entity that operates independently. In other words, the mind and body are fundamentally interconnected and dependent on one another. The body provides the inputs and the brain interprets them, but the physical body, not just the brain, is involved in the actual processing and decision making.

The body, then, has its own independent intelligence, separate from the brain. It can interpret and respond to external stimuli and even make decisions based on its own internal processes. This is why robot dynamics, the study of how robots move and interact with the environment, has become increasingly important in understanding the body's intelligent responses. In robotics, the "body" is the physical machine, such as a robotic arm, and the "brain" is the programming that determines how the robotic arm responds to the environment. By studying how the robotic arm moves in response to external stimuli, we can gain a better understanding of how the body can use its own intelligence to interpret and respond to the environment. 

~~~In conclusion, the brain is the least understood organ in our bodies, yet it is also the most important for understanding intelligence. Understanding the body's independent intelligence, separate from the brain's, is essential to gain a better understanding of how the brain works. By studying robotics and robot dynamics, we can gain insight into the body's own intelligence and the interactions between the body and the environment. The metaphors of the past, while useful, have hindered our understanding of the body's independent intelligence. By focusing on the body's physical intelligence and not just the brain's, we can gain a better understanding of the true nature of intelligence.~~~


## passive dynamic walker notes
- passive self-organization, or how things "just work" when combined in the right way
- the passive dynamic walker. It works on the ramp at a particular angle. It doesn't have microprocessors, it doesn't have a motor, it doesn't have sensors. So it's a completely passive structure. And because it doesn't have sensors and motors and processors, this phenomenon is called self stabilization. So it's the mechanical structure of the system that stabilizes itself.
- Now, in human walking, the biomechanics people tell us that the swing forward is also largely passive. So what the brain does in this case, it doesn't control in detail the trajectories of the joints, but it controls the body posture. And then if this leg in walking is here in the back, it has to come forward. And so with the body posture, the leg becomes like a pendulum. So we let gravity work for us, and then the leg comes forward. And because it's like a pendulum, the muscles are largely, they have low stiffness, they're not doing very much. And so it's also a very energy saving. And then you get this natural feel to it. Now, for example, the trajectory of the knee is not directly controlled by the brain. Still, it does the right thing. Now, the fact that it's not directly controlled does not imply it's not doing the right thing. So we say our jargon is the knee passively self organizes into the proper trajectory. 
- there is mechanical feedback that actually accounts for the stabilization of the mechanical structure. Now, the fact that the robot doesn't have sensors, and so the robot doesn't know about this mechanical feedback, does not imply that it's not there. It's there and it accounts for the stability, again, phenomenon of self stabilization
- Where is the ability for walking stored in the passive dynamic walker? I mean, in the human brain, it's relatively well known which regions are involved in walking. Where is it here? There is no brain, no microprocessor, no computer memory. So it's basically distributed in the specific setup of the robot, the weight distribution, the materials, the frictional characteristics, and so on and so forth.
- here is a task distribution between brain body, which includes morphology and materials. And when I talk about morphology, it means, of course, the setup, the anatomy in a biological system, the sensors, the physical quality of the sensors, the distribution of the sensors on the organisms, and so on and so forth. Now, if you see the passive dynamic walker or the knees by Martin Vise, the control is not localized in a particular place, but it's sort of distributed throughout the organism.
- There is a difference between the behavior of a biological system and that of a cognitive robot. Biological systems are always moving and they generate patterns of sensory stimulation through physical interaction with the environment, which is the raw material for the brain to process. These patterns of sensory stimulation that are induced, in fact contain correlations - you see what something looks like, sounds like, feels like to the touch. with a few examples, the brain starts to categorize information and with a simple bayesian learning process can start making predictions.


- reafference principle: "self-initiated action evokes sensory effects that are correlated with these actions and, therefore, can be predicted and used. We understand reafference itself as any effect on an organism's sensory mechanisms that is due to the animal's own actions" (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0764#d1e415). "he organism is able to predict the sensory consequence of its own action, that is, the stimulation that might occur as a result of its own movement." (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.765646/). 
- The first time we perceive something in the outside world, we feel a corresponding sensation eg: we sniff the air around a rose and feel the sweet odour. Reafference says that the next time around, we can - without sniffing a rose - predict what it might smell like. In this scenario, our brain has correlated two things (_integrated information theory_) - the image of a rose and its smell - and is able to predict what a rose might smell like, or what a flower that smells like a rose might look like. Having implicitly categorized the sensory information, it can now make predictions.



## The body is a window into the mind
From the ancient Chinese philosophical concepts of yin and yang to the rise of somatic psychology in the 20th century, there is a growing recognition that the body is not a separate entity from the mind, but an extension of it. Our physical form is inextricably linked to our thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Arts such as Aikido, Yoga and Qi Gong teach us to use our bodies to cultivate inner peace and strength. Modern body work, including Feldenkrais and Alexander Technique, focus on the individual's unique body structure and movement patterns to foster greater physical and emotional well-being. Through these diverse practices weaves a common thread of body mindfulness, or (re)uniting the body and mind. Yoga is more than holding your limbs in pretzel shapes; deeper practices lay great emphasis on being sensitive to how each engaged muscle feels. Aikidoka “keep the mind” or maintain awareness of their center, a spot close to the body’s center of gravity.

## Breathwork
Another common theme in all these practices is breathwork, or the practice of consciously and intentionally controlling the breath. The breath is often thought of as a simple and automatic bodily function, but it can be used as a powerful tool to regulate our mental and physical states.. When we breathe deeply and slowly, the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the fight-or-flight response, calms down. This can be achieved by taking in two breaths through the nose and then exhaling for a longer period of time, known as a “physiological sigh.”  This technique surges oxygen into the bloodstream and purges carbon dioxide and stored tension on the way out. A study found that simply being cognizant of one's breath expanded brain activity in the hippocampus (___), insula (associated with emotion), and anterior cingulate cortex (regulates blood pressure and heart rate).  Although more research is necessary to establish causal links between breathwork, these brain states and their corresponding effects, it is clear from personal experience that our breath is closely related to how calm or agitated we feel.


## Shapiro's theory of evolution
Shapiro's theory of evolution is that the evolution of life is based on the emergence of new, more complex forms of organization, rather than on the selection of random genetic mutations. He argues that this process is driven by the laws of physics and chemistry, rather than by natural selection. According to Shapiro, evolution is guided by the laws of thermodynamics and the tendency of matter to self-organize into more complex structures. This theory is still being debated among evolutionary biologists.
