Vipassana is a belief system that aims to help individuals perceive reality as it truly is, by rewiring the brain and unlearning deeply ingrained habits that obstruct this perception. At its core, it is about understanding the world through the framework of our bodies, by the intent study of the physical sensations and feelings that various events and stimuli create.

In our daily lives, we rely on our sense organs to gather information about the world around us. Our eyes capture light and interpret it as images, while our ears resonate with sound waves and interpret them as sound. We can even detect the smell of cooking kebabs from a distance. All of these stimuli leave an impression on us, whether it's the growling of our stomachs in response to the aroma of food, or a feeling of outrage when we witness injustice. Each event or experience carries with it certain information that creates a physical sensation when we perceive it.

Our inherent behaviors often dictate how we respond to these sensations. A child with a low tolerance for pain, for example, might cry out for help rather than finding a bandage to address their injury. Sometimes, we are able to consciously evaluate our responses and make a rational decision based on the situation. However, we often have reflexive responses that we are not even aware of. As soon as a physical sensation arises, we may have a conditioned response that has been ingrained over many years of experience. If left unchecked, these habitual patterns can lead to actions that are based on automatic responses rather than a considered and thoughtful process.

To gain control over these reflexes, it is important to first identify where they come from. The Default Mode Network, or the shortcut heuristic, can sometimes mislead us by attributing the cause of an action to the event itself rather than the physical sensation created by the perception of that event.
