As human beings, we are constantly bombarded with information about the world around us through our senses. Our eyes see the light and our brains interpret it as images, while our ears pick up on different frequencies and translate them into sound. Our sense of smell can detect kebabs roasting a mile away. These stimuli trigger complex biochemical systems in our body which can sometimes be felt as distinct physical sensations. For example, even thinking of those kebabs might make your stomach rumble and your mouth water, especially if you haven't eaten today.
