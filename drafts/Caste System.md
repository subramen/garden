A conversation with French Indophiles near Ponidcherry quickly moved to the topic of castes in India. I boasted that I can identify most Indians' castes by their names or physical profiles. I proposed a theory that Shudras were enslaved classes at the time of the Aryan invasion, which is why those classes have different physical features (eg: round negroid noses).

The French couldn't digest that caste is based on blood; in their egalitarian society, they didn't have a caste system (I dismissed this as a false argument), and an informal caste system was based on wealth and members were mobile across classes.

The indian caste system, on the other hand, was organized on the basis of members' duties towards societies. Each varna has a distinct set of responsibilities and the Indian caste system can be seen as an occupational organization.

I sensed however that what I was talking was actually shit. I hadn't thought about this subject, nor had I done any reading. I was perhaps perpetuating subconscious beliefs and ideas as truths. 

Ambedkar dismisses the caste system as an innocent division based on occupation, instead calling it a system of GRADED INEQUALITY that dictates the quality of life and legal rights of people. Ambedkar's theory proposes that Shudras were a Khsatriya community in Indo-Aryan society that antagonized Brahmins, in response to which Brahmanical laws severely degraded the Shudra community's standing amongst the peoples by denying them education, respect and so on. Over time, the name Shudra came to be associated with any people lacking culture. Contemporarliy, tribes that are labelled Shudras don't have anyhting in common with the Indo-Aryan Shudra community.
