## Notes on the moon and the mind

* Psychology and psychiatry is overwhelmingly qualitative by nature because we don't have the tools to adequately qunatify mental states.
* A lot of the qualitative measure ments are self-reported.
* To self-report accurately, this mechanism presupposes an adequate skill in interoceptive awareness, which we lack in general. 
* So studies like https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6450680/ are as ungrounded as the "myth" they are trying to dismiss.
