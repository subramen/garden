### Problem: Forecasting solar PV output
Forecasting solar photovoltaic (PV) power production is hard: As clouds move over PV panels, the power output moves up and down rapidly. To keep the energy grid in balance, operators need to have readily available power generation reserves which usually come from fossil fuel sources.

Open Climate Fix has a project for "nowcasting" cloud cover and resultant energy production. https://github.com/openclimatefix/nowcasting
