MILA Quebec's First Languages Initiative seeks to reconnect native peoples to their near-forgotten ways of life. Using the metaverse, indigenous peoples can immersively experience their culture, language and traditions, preserving memories of their culture. The project appears to currently focus on ASR for indigenous languages that will facilitate communication in native languages on the metaverse. The project is lead by *Michael Running Wolf* at McGill.
